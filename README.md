# Various sample Colaboratory notebooks

[Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/) is a free Jupyter notebook environment that requires no setup and runs entirely in Google Cloud. You need to have a Google resp Gmail account in order to use Colab notebooks.

Colab can run using Python 2.7 or 3.6 runtimes, with a reasonably broad range of Python packages pre-installed (e.g. tensorflow, numpy, pandas ...). This repo provides various sample Colab notebooks that show how to install and perform first steps using several Python packages that are slightly more difficult to install, e.g. [DeepChem](https://deepchem.io/) or [Dlib](http://dlib.net/).
